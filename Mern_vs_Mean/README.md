# Difference betweem MERN Stack and MEAN Stack

## What is a Technology Stack?

A technology stack, often referred to as a tech stack, is a combination of different software and programming languages used to build and run a web or mobile application. It encompasses various layers or components, each serving a specific purpose within the application's architecture. A typical technology stack is composed of the following layers:

Client-Side (Frontend):

User Interface (UI): The visual components that users interact with.
Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is commonly used for client-side scripting to enhance the interactivity of the UI.
Server-Side (Backend):

Server: Handles the business logic, processes requests from clients, and communicates with the database.
Application Layer: Where the server-side logic and processing occur.
Database: Stores and manages data.
Database:

Database Management System (DBMS): Software that manages and organizes data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
Middleware:

Connectivity and Communication: Tools and protocols to facilitate communication between the client-side and server-side components.
Development Tools:

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Software for developers to write, test, and debug code.
Version Control Systems: Tools like Git for tracking changes in the codebase.
Operating System and Infrastructure:

Operating System (OS): The underlying software that manages hardware resources.
Server Infrastructure: The physical or virtual servers where the application is hosted.
Networking:

Protocols and APIs: Facilitate communication between different components and services.
The choice of a technology stack depends on various factors such as project requirements, scalability needs, development team expertise, and business objectives. Different applications may use different stacks; for example, a web application might use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), Node.js or Django (backend), and a database like MongoDB or MySQL. Similarly, a mobile app might have a different stack, such as Swift or Kotlin for native development or React Native for cross-platform development.

## What is MEAN Stack?

MEAN stack is defined as a collection of JavaScript technologies that can assist in building complex websites or web apps

 - MongoDB + Express.js + Angular + node.js

It is a framework that provides the most popular plugins and also reduces the time on system administration. If you want to speed up the process of web and mobile app development, it is an appropriate choice

## What is MERN Stack?

Like MEAN stack, MERN Stack it also has comprised of four frameworks, namely MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js

- MongoDB + Express.js + React + node.js 

For developing web apps, it makes use of libraries, databases, and frameworks. MERN stack ensures a very smooth development process. The MERN stack is becoming very popular in the development market
