# Getting Started with MongoDB and Mongoose for Backend Development

This guide will walk you through setting up a basic backend using MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.

1. First, create a new account on StackBlitz if you haven't already.
2. Create a new backend project and select Express.js as the framework.
3. In the project directory, create a new folder named models.
4. Inside the models folder, create three new files: sub_todo.models.js, todo.models.js, and user.models.js.
5. Open the terminal in StackBlitz and run the following command to install Mongoose:

```sh
npm install mongoose
```
