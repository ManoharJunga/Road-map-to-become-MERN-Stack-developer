# JavaScript Basics

This project contains the basic setup for learning JavaScript from scratch. It includes an HTML file that links to a JavaScript file, allowing you to practice and understand fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that links to the JavaScript file.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file where you can write and execute your JavaScript code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom)

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**


```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManoharJunga/Road-map-to-become-MERN-Stack-developer/tree/main/Javascript/Javascript_basic.git
   cd javascript_basic
```

2. Open the Project in Your Code Editor

Open the cloned repository folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Run the Project

Open the index.html file in your web browser by either:

Double-clicking the index.html file, or
Opening the file from your code editor's terminal with a browser (e.g., open index.html on MacOS, start index.html on Windows).


`index.html`

```html
